Reverse strings. Some strings are their own mirror image, if they are read left to right
(conventionally) or read right to left, they spell the same word. For example “Bob”, “ABBA”,
“eye”, “noon” are all reversible, while “John” and “Stirling” are not. Write a function which
takes a string as input and returns True if it is spelt the same way in both directions, and
False otherwise. There are multiple ways to achieve this – try and implement at least two
different ways.
